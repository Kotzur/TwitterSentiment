## Part II Project: Sentiment Diversification of Twitter Posts ##
The purpose of this project is to create an application composed of a __sentiment 
classifier__ of opinions in Twitter posts ("Tweets") and a __user interface__ which juxtapositions 
Tweets with sentiment different to the post chosen by the user. The sentiment classifier will evaluate 
the Tweet's opinion by classifying it as either positive or negative whereas the aim of the interface will 
be to study how users respond to __diversified content__.
