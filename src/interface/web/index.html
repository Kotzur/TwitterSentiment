            The purpose of this experiment is to explore the relationships
            between opinions expressed online and the way that users relate to them. The study is in a form of an opinion quiz.<br/><br/>
            Input a topic of your choice into the search box at the top and hit Enter.<br/>
            You will be presented with a pair of opinions from Twitter. You are asked to choose the message you agree with the most by clicking on it.<br/>
            To aid your decision, supporting tweets appear under the message if you hover over it.<br/>
            After selecting your choice, you will be presented with the next pair of arguments to choose from. The quiz continues in this way through nine pairs of arguments and
            ends with a results screen. Following the experiment, there will be a discussion about your experience.<br/><br/>
            Messages displayed are taken from Twitter.com and can be found by performing the same queries on their website. Opinions expressed in the messages displayed do
            not reflect our opinions and may contain upsetting content.</p>
